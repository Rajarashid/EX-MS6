    A good website is a responsive website. The user does something—clicks a button,
    moves the mouse, presses a key—and something happens. JavaScript gives you many ways to
    respond to the user's needs. A few examples:
    The user clicks a button saying "Our Guarantee" and an alert displays spelling out the
    guarantee.
    A page displays a "before" picture of a model. When the user mouses over the picture, it
    is replaced by an "after" picture of her.
    The user types a number in the Ounces field on a form. When she clicks in the Grams
    field, the equivalent in grams displays.
    The user has entered her email address in a form, and is about to type a comment. When
    she moves the cursor from the email field to the comment field, JavaScript checks to see if the
    email address is valid. In this case, it isn't—she's omitted ".com" at the end of the address. A
    message displays letting her know that she's entered an invalid email address.
    On an online shopping site, there's a picture of a black watch. Next to it is a drop-down
    list asking the user to choose a color. When she chooses, the color of the watch in the picture
    changes to that color.
    All of these user actions—clicking a button, moving the mouse, moving from one field to
    another in a form, selecting a different option—are known as events. JavaScript code that
    responds to an event—for example, displaying a guarantee or swapping an image when the
    pointer hovers over it—is called an event handler.
    In this chapter and the ones that immediately follow, you'll learn the oldest and most
    straightforward approach to event-handling—inline event-handling. When you're writing
    production code, this is not the best way to handle events, for the same reason that inline CSS
    styling isn't the best way to format HTML elements. But since it's the least abstract way to do
    it, it's the easiest to learn, and can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced methods. Later
    in the book, you'll learn the approach that's preferred by most professionals—the scripting
    approach.
    Inline event-handling means that you combine bits of JavaScript with HTML markup.
    Here's a line that displays a link and then displays an alert when the user clicks it.
    <a href="#" onClick="alert('Hi');">Click</a>
    As an HTML coder, you're familiar with the beginning and end of this markup, <a href=and>Click</a>
    But when the user clicks this link, it behaves differently than normal hyperlinks. Instead of
    taking the user to another page, or to a named anchor on the same page, it displays an alert
    saying "Hi".

    When the user clicks the link, it goes nowhere, and instead executes a JavaScript
    statement, in this case calling a function.
    Let's break it down.
    When the user clicks the link, you don't want a new webpage to be loaded in this case, so,
    instead of a URL, you place a # inside the quotation marks. This tells the browser to
    reload the current page.
    onClick= says, "When the button is clicked, execute the following JavaScript." onClick
    isn't case-sensitive. You could write onclick, ONCLICK, or OnClIcK and it would work.
    But the convention is onClick, so we'll stick with that.
    A JavaScript statement (or more than one), enclosed in quotes, follows. When the user
    clicks the link, it executes.
    One more thing to notice: onClick="alert('Hi');" The message inside the parens is
    surrounded by single quotes, not the double quotes we've been using for an alert string. In
    JavaScript code, you aren't allowed to nest double quotes within double quotes or single
    quotes within single quotess. Since the entire JavaScript statement is enclosed in double
    quotes, you have to enclose the alert message in single quotes.
    But there's a problem with the markup above. <a href="#" tells the browser to reload the page. This means that if
      the user has scrolled down to the link, the click, in addition to running the JavaScript code, will scroll the
      page back to the top—an action you don't normally want. I've included this flawed approach, using <a href="#" ,
      because you'll run into here and there in other people's work, but you'll probably prefer this approach: <a
      href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('Hi');">Click</a>
    Now you've got exactly what you want. Nothing at all happens except for the JavaScript
    that executes.
    In the example above, the click executes only a single JavaScript statement. But there is
    no limit to the number of JavaScript statements that you can enclose in the quotation marks. No
    limit, that is, except for common sense. As you'll see, there are better ways to trigger
    JavaScript than packing multiple statements into an online onClick event. But let me show you
    the principle, with this example. When the user clicks, a first statement assigns 'hi' to a
    variable and a second statement displays an alert specifying the variable as the message.
    <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="var greet=" hi'; alert(greet);">Click</a>
    As I've said, coding professionals frown on inline JavaScript. But if you do use this
    approach, it's more craftsmanlike to call a function.
    Here's a function.

  <a href="Javascript:void(0)" onclick="alert('called !')"> Mujhe Dabao !</a>
  <input type="button" value="Click" onClick="alert('phr se ! :)');">
